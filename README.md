Portfolio for graphics designer

## Attempt to create a portfolio for Mayowa Adeyeye a Graphics Designer
design inspiration is taken from Maison Chérie — Product Designer Portfolio dribbble.com

## Design Elements for the project
I am going to be assuming color palettes for the designer, typography and other related design elements untill a structure is ready and can be reviewed by the designer.

## Timeline for review
I give myself a space of 3 weeks to get to review stage for this project.
